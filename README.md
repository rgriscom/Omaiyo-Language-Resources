## 1. Introduction
This project is a collection of data from a variety of different sources, all related to the language of northern Tanzania known as Omaiyo or Omaio. As of the last data collection period in 2018, this language was moribund and spoken by only three semi-speakers:

* **Nairuko Siruwananga:** Female. The speaker who remembers the most, sister of Leperia. Hard of hearing. 
* **Leperia Mbogo:** Male, ~75 years old. Knows a few words, brother of Nairuko. Very frail and unable to see well.  
* **Langaseki Olepaw:** Male, ~80 years old.Learned some Omaiyo from the other speakers but was not raised as an Omaiyo speaker.
